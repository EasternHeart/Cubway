# Cubway

Cubway is a extended browser implemented using the [QtWebKit Bridge](http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qtwebkit-bridge.html) for writing native apps in HTML5.
Unlike other similar project such as NW.js and Electron, it does NOT have a Node.js binding and there is a plugin system in it for creating C++ extensions.

## TODO

* Turn into a modularity structure of Cubway Controller/View.
* Implement more features such as DBus interface and file management.
