# Cubway

Cubway is an extended browser implemented using the [QtWebKit Bridge](http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qtwebkit-bridge.html) for writing native apps in HTML5.
Unlike other similar projects such as NW.js and Electron, it works without a Node.js binding but with a plugin system which can create C++ extensions. This mechanism occupies much less memory than that works with a Node.js binding.

Being a part of the Subway Project, this project focuses more on (GNU/Linux) desktop integration.

## TODO

* Turn into a modularity structure of Cubway Controller/View.
* Implement more features such as DBus interface and file management.
